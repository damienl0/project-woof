			<h2>Information on Rottweilers, Say No More</h2>
			<p>The Rottweiler is a breed of domestic dog. The dogs were known in German as Rottweiler Metzgerhund, meaning Rottweil butchers' dogs, because one of their uses was to herd livestock and pull carts laden with butchered meat to the market.

				<h3>Fun Rottweiler Facts</h3>
				<h4>Fact 1: A Dog of Roman Descent</h4>
			<ul type="circle">
				<li>It is believed that the Rottweiler is a descendant of the ancient Roman drover dogs, which accompanied the herds the Romans brought with them when they invaded Europe.</li>
			<h4>Fact 2: Close to Extinction</h4>
				<li>they were originally bred for their herding and guarding instincts, it only stood to reason that as the need for those services diminished, so did the popularity of the Rottweiler. Then, in the early 1900s, a newly formed club established a new breed standard for the dog and they began to flourish.</li>
			<h4>Fact 3: They Are Known for Their Affection and Loyalty</h4>
				<li>While they may appear intimidating at first, Rottweilers are known by their owners to be fiercly loving, loyal, affectionate and even playful. Keep in mind, though, that the breed tends to be reserved when confronted with strangers and proper training is necessary to teach them social skills and harness their protective instincts.</li>
			<h4>Fact 4: They Think They're Lap Dogs</h4>
				<li>Despite their large size, Rottweilers haven't the slighest idea that they may be hard to cuddle with so don't be surprised when yours tries desperately to climb into your lap.</li>
			<h4>Fact 5: A New Job for a New Rottweiler</h4>
				<li>While herding was the name of the game for the Rottweilers of Roman times, when they reimerged in the 1900s they were used primiarly for police work.</li>
